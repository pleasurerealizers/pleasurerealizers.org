# Deeply loving the present moment is actually possible. Let's make passionate love for existence available to everyone.
Welcome to the Pleasure Realizers.
# Definitions
To be able to characterize Pleasure Realizers, we first need to introduce a few core concepts. They might be used here in a slightly different context than you are used to, so try to ignore what you already know about the meaning of these terms. Note that in the rest of this text, these terms ("environment", "pleasure", "love", "wisdom", "flourishing") will be used exclusively as defined below.
## Environment
In this context, your "environment" refers to everything which is **beyond** what you call your "self" or your "I". That is, the people and other beings around you as well as nature.
## Pleasure
"Pleasure" in the context of this framework refers to **subjective well-being in the present moment**. Colloquially, it can be interpreted as simply "feeling good", with all the subjective impreciseness this implies. Note the focus on the individual and subjectivity at this stage, which will be resolved implicitly later, as the goal of "flourishing" below is to intentionally dissolve [subject-object-split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_and_object_(philosophy)) anyway.

More concretely, this concept of pleasure can roughly be grouped into three aspects. Note that these aspects should not be seen as "stages" or a "sequence", but instead as parts which are all equally relevant without any specific order.
### Not suffering
This refers to the **fulfillment of basic needs**. After all, walking on the path towards flourishing is severely inhibited or pretty much impossible if someone is finding themselves in a state where immediate needs like the following are unfulfilled (the bottom layers of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), plus the most fundamental existential need):
- food, water, warmth, rest (surviving)
- physical or emotional safety (feeling safe)
- trust, belonging, self-confidence and freedom (feeling like your presence is appreciated and that you are trusted and loved, both by yourself and by others)
- accepting death
### Pleasurable stability
This refers to **being in a state where the fulfillment of these basic needs is something you subjectively perceive as stable**, i.e. where you don't need to be afraid of losing them. It includes factors such as:
- knowing that you have stable structures around you which ensure that you always have enough food, water, warmth and housing
- knowing that you genuinely appreciate your own body and feel safe in your own mind
- feeling a sense of belonging and living in circumstances which you like calling „home“, both physically and socially
- having structures where the fulfillment of some of your needs doesn't contradict the fulfillment of others (= freedom)
- having people in your social circles with whom you feel like you are not judged for embracing what feels pleasurable (= "authentic" or "true") to you
- knowing that you can always love and that you are always loved, no matter what happens
- knowing that you have found peace with death, both your own and those of parts of your environment (e.g. other people you love)
- knowing that, even if some of your basic needs are not fulfilled, you always have the **hope** that it will get better and that you always have the **strength** to act accordingly
- knowing that, even in situations which feel immensely catastrophic, confusing or hopeless at first, you know that you can handle this, both through your own resilience and possibly through a support network around you, people who care and people who help you find your own way back towards pleasurable stability
- having daily routines which consistently "feel good" and which you want to keep, because you know that they contribute to your pleasure in the future

After all, of course the future itself (including any notion of "true stability") doesn't exist, it's just the emotions connected to your outlook into the future which matter, e.g. through hope, optimism, excitement, confidence and contentment. Such emotions deserve to be fostered, not through naivety but through deliberative action.

Some associated terms for pleasurable stability include (both English and German):
- life satisfaction (Lebenszufriedenheit)
- joy of life (Lebensfreude)
- quality of life (Lebensqualität)
- fulfillment (Erfüllung)
- [subjective well-being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_well-being) and many other concepts studied by [positive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology)
- cultivating [brahmavihārā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmavihara) in buddhism
- [kama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama) in Dharmic religions
- [ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai)
### Peak experiences
This refers to **an experience in which a limited set of pleasurable aspects is strongly emphasized temporarily**. Note that the temporary nature is what makes them pleasurable, i.e. living an entire life in only a single peak experience would typically not be sustainable or feasible in the long term.

This is yet another term from Maslow, who described [peak experiences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_experience) as "rare, exciting, oceanic, deeply moving, exhilarating, elevating experiences that generate an advanced form of perceiving reality, and are even mystic and magical in their effect upon the experimenter."

Of course in practice, peak experiences can come in varying intensities. Some very general examples include:
- a deep meditative session
- creative flow while creating art (e.g. writing, composing, painting etc.)
- being in a deep conversation with someone where you don't even notice time flying
- being at an event where you have many experiences which feel incredibly meaningful, pleasurable and inspirational to you (e.g. a burn)
- the mystical experience of an intense, but highly insightful trip on psychedelics
- a highly pleasurable sexual or sensual session (e.g. tantra, amazing orgasms, [subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_BDSM#Subspace) and topspace in BDSM etc.)
- dancing all night long to music you love and getting lost in the music (e.g. at a rave)
- feeling a rush of gratitude for someone's genuine presence in a vulnerable moment
- awe-inspiring natural encounters (e.g. watching a sunrise from a mountaintop after a long hike)
- religious celebrations for respective believers such as [Yom Kippur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur), [Eid al-Fitr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr), [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas), [Vesak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesak), [Chinese New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year) and many more (pretty much all cultures have institutionalized peak experiences)

Some associated terms include:
- euphoria (Euphorie)
- ecstasy (Ekstase)
- bliss (Glückseligkeit)
- rapture (Entzücken)
- elation (Beschwingtheit)
- [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) in the works of Csikszentmihalyi

## Love
With the previous definition of pleasure, "love" can be defined as **the desire to realize pleasure**. It can be directed towards anything – the self, another being, nature or anything in between. Some associated terms include:
- good will
- [eunoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunoia) in the works of Aristotle
- various [Greek words for love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_words_for_love), incl. [philautia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philautia) (self-love) and [agape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape)

- [ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) in various African cultures
- [aloha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha) in Hawaiian culture
## Wisdom
In a similar fashion, "wisdom" can be defined as **the knowledge of ways to realize pleasure**. Some associated terms include:
- [phronesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phronesis) in the works of Aristotle
- [zhi](https://inst-east-and-west.org/en/learning/2019/002725.html) in Confucianism

	- [puruṣārtha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puru%E1%B9%A3%C4%81rtha) in Hinduism
## Flourishing
Finally, in this context, "flourishing" is defined as **a hypothetical, idealized state of existence where pleasure is the norm in all aspects of life**. It is equivalent to "holistic subjective pleasure for everyone" = "holistic collective pleasure" Some associated terms include:

	- [eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia)
	- [moksha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha) or [nirvana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana) in Dharmic religions
	- [buddhahood or sammā-sambodhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhahood) in Buddhism (through [bodhicitta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhicitta))
	- various notions of excellence, such as
		- [arete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete) in the works of Aristotle
		- [pāramitā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81ramit%C4%81) in Buddhism
# Why?
The next question is: **"Why should we even strive for flourishing?"**
## Evolution
From an evolutionary standpoint considering [self-preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation) it makes sense: A species which adapts well to its environment has the best chances to survive in the long-term. This means that such a species contributes to a long-term equilibrium in its ecosystem and for it, continuous synergy with its environment is equivalent to pleasurable stability. Others die eventually, for instance due to resource exhaustion, because they are killed by other actors in that ecosystem or because they kill themselves or each other.
## Existential reasoning
Those who are more existentially doubtful and try to objectively rationalize subjective pleasure might desire deeper philosophical investigation. The following section makes an attempt at such reasoning from the perspective of actors which perceive self-reflection. Note that this section is consciously agnostic towards any arguments related to transcendence, meaning that it does not assume or reject the existence of any state of being before birth or after death ([anamnesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy))).

This argument **for** pleasure is valid **purely for the current moment**. But because this argumentative chain is always valid **at least** as long as you possess self-reflection and a body, it should become **subjectively infinite** (eternal now).

**Trigger warning: The following section mentions suicide.**

This argumentative chain starts with the ultimate universal starting point ([Letztbegründung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letztbegr%C3%BCndung)) of "**Every human experiences their own existence**", involving that right now,
- you are experiencing self-awareness, i.e.
	- you are recognizing the existence of your own consciousness,
	- you thus recognize the existence of your self/ego/I, and
- you experience having a body.

While not assuming or rejecting [mind-body dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism), you still intuitively know that your mind is at least somehow connected to your body ([embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition)) and that your mind has at least some level of control over your body. Even if it might not be in control all the time, you can still make "conscious" decisions about what to do with your body, e.g. how you want to move your body, where you want to go to, what you want to say to whom, etc. That is, I assume that you **subjectively** perceive that you have at least a certain level of **free will**.

However, this free will to move your body in whichever way you want also implies the **ability for you to decide for suicide** or to otherwise destroy your own body. After all, you could easily acquire all the necessary tools and techniques to cause your body to stop functioning in its usual way. So the next question is **"Do I want to live or do I want to die?"**

To attempt answering this question, let's use the following rather narrow definitions, consistent with the previous paragraph: "living = the body functioning as usual" and "dying = making the body stop functioning as usual". Meaning that in this limited definition of "living", we come to the conclusion that "being alive" is pretty much equivalent to "having a body". Now, **what does it mean to have a body?**

Let's look again at all the different aspects mentioned above in the section "Pleasure" and what the presence of pleasure can look like. The thing they have in common is that they all **somehow involve the body**. Again, this shall not imply or contradict that after your body ceases to exist, you couldn't experience any pleasures at all anymore. But at least to experience the types of pleasure you **know**, you need a body and you shouldn't be dead. At the same time though, through your body you can also experience incredibly unpleasurable things, typically known as "pain" or "suffering". Of course in some cases, you can reinterpret this pain to foster learning, self-discipline, resilience or [equanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity), but no matter how you deal with it, initially it will always be pain.

But after all, you have a **choice**, which is by definition the most important choice of your life:
- Either you consciously decide for death, after which you have no idea what will happen. Maybe pleasure, maybe suffering, maybe something totally different which cannot even be fathomed with our thoughts or words.
- Or you consciously decide for life, which will imply both earthly pleasures (as outlined above) and earthly suffering. And remember that before, you acknowledged that you have at least a certain level of free will and agency over what you want your body to do, meaning that you are the **architect** of your own pleasure and you can make decisions and behave in ways which lead you towards more subjective pleasure and away from subjective suffering.

This is very similar to the argument which Camus makes for [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism), where we also all see ourselves as Sisyphos, but with the difference that we assume to have free will and can go towards holistic pleasure if we want to. Even though everything might still be ultimately meaningless, we still have free will most of the time, meaning that we can **decide** whether we want to roll up an immense boulder up a hill for eternity, or whether we want to do other things which would still be meaningless, but can instead be really pleasurable in the moment.

To give an example, compare your life to gardening: No matter what you plant, eventually it will always die, including yourself, the planter! If you would want to, you could die right away and will never need to think about the right fertilizer, thunderstorms or lack of sunlight harming your crops or caring for a crop in the wrong way so that it dies.

But working in the garden itself, seeing each seed grow and blossom with the compost of yesteryear, inviting friends to garden parties and embracing this nurturing symbiosis with your surroundings will be an awesome experience again and again. You have an unlimited number of variants of seeds, some for grains or juicy fruits which nourish you, some for magical herbs which heal you or make your mind travel to distant worlds, some for cheeky flowers which blossom for just a few days per year, some for large trees which will far outlive you. Some of these seeds represent stability, some might represent playfulness, juiciness, care, a healthy relationship to death, self-love, trust, authenticity, community, love with others or anything else you want to foster in your life. The purpose of Pleasure Realizers is to form structures in which we can all nurture our individual and collective gardens of existence and to make them flourish, to exchange knowledge about the best holistic gardening techniques and to find people for the best garden parties ever.

After all, your body is just a temporary gift. Probably you also have no idea why you have it. Just like any other gift, no one forces you to keep it. But it's a really damn nice gift if you consider all the fun and fulfillment you can have with it.

If you continue reading on, I will assume that you have decided for life, for your body, for pleasure and, to get on the path towards flourishing, for realizing pleasure.
## Meta-belief
Consider a way of thinking which still has a major influence today: [Cartesianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesianism), the philosophical system developed by René Descartes, which implies a fundamental [separation between the mind and the body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism). Or, more generally, the mind and its environment, leading to a high degree of individuality as well as everything that implies, e.g. isolation, neglecting emotions or dehumanizing certain humans in the [amity-enmity-complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amity%E2%80%93enmity_complex), but also empowerment, self-determination and resilience. Cartesianism sees the mind and its rational reasoning as superior, expressed through the commonly known phrase "I think, therefore I am". But opposing the irrational, dogmatic [religious exclusivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_exclusivism) of religions (i.e. the belief that only one particular belief system is true) should also imply opposing the absolute truth of "the mind is superior over the body", i.e. true rationalism should contradict its own absoluteness.

But let's go further into the meta perspective: Fundamentally, of course thinking itself can be pleasurable as well. No matter whether it's in a "typically philosophical" or a "typically religious" domain. Few things feel better than the flow of thinking about complex subjects, engaging in the deepest conversations imaginable, having new insights, "aha moments", noticing connections between different concepts, feeling that you're "on the right track" and the satisfying feeling of understanding and clarity. And of course the peace of mind which someone has when they are deeply convinced that they have found "the truth" and clearly know how to act accordingly (= enlightenment) is something immensely pleasurable as well.

So one thing should be clear: As long as we have the subjective experience **that** we are thinking, we also have a body. And if we have a body anyway which can experience pleasure in more realms than just the cognitive (and mental well-being is even enhanced by physical well-being!), then why not realize those pleasures as well?

This means that we look at the concept of "thinking according to a certain belief system" from the outside. Devotedly following any belief system **is the act itself** which brings pleasure, because **it's always a human doing the thinking**. Thus we can adopt "pleasure" as the **ultimate meta-belief**, implying ultimate religious pluralism, because pleasure is fundamentally equivalent to "being human" and the subjective experience of every other belief in the present moment can be reinterpreted as somehow being directed by pleasure (e.g. a manifestation of pleasure or the longing for pleasure).

# Characterizing Pleasure Realizers
## The framework
First, let's make some **observations** about the nature of flourishing. The first one is a **commitment** by you.

1. **metamotivation**: I strive for flourishing.
2. **oneness of mind**: I recognize that every other individual in my environment is also striving for flourishing.
3. **subjectivity**: I recognize that flourishing can mean something different for every being.
4. **reflection**: I recognize that my personal flourishing mirrors the flourishing of my environment.
5. **incompleteness**: I recognize that flourishing can never be ultimately reached, instead it always has a process and project character.

The intention of Pleasure Realizers can be summarized by **Building bridges of pleasure between reality and flourishing.** This means that next, we have the **bridge**, i.e. how the abstract, idealized, future-thinking, unachievable "goal" of flourishing is connected to subjective pleasure in the moment:

- **orientation**: Making steps **towards** flourishing happens by realizing subjective pleasure, both in the present moment and in an anticipatory way.

And finally, the **intentions** for being able to actually build these bridges of pleasure:

1. **understanding the self**: I want to learn and understand what it means for me to experience pleasure.
2. **understanding others**: I want to learn and understand what experiencing pleasure means for my environment.
3. **realizing pleasure for the self**: I want to actively infuse every aspect of my own life with pleasure, both my thoughts and my behaviors. I see myself as the core creator and cultivator of my own pleasure.
4. **realizing symbiotic pleasure**: I want to discover and realize ways how interactions with my environment result in experiencing more pleasure on all sides.

It can be easily seen that the fundamental flaw of many belief systems to date is that flourishing (= a better [world to come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_to_come)) has always been seen as something abstract, mythological, metaphysical, non-empirical, hard to understand, even harder to achieve, sometimes even forbidden to think about and often as something which is seen as created externally (e.g. by gods) and/or which is only accessible after death.

But no matter whether it's with yourself, with nature, in a one-on-one friendship, a small community, an entire society or an entire ecosystem: When having a shared compass which points towards genuine, reflected, holistic flourishing by seeing humans as "ultimate collaborators" instead of "ultimate competitors" and, in the process, working on realizing subjective and thus symbiotic pleasure in a constructive, non-perfectionist, self-directed, decentralized, collaborative, strategic, step-by-step manner, "heaven on earth" can start feeling more and more achievable.
## This website
pleasurerealizers.org is fundamentally about **bringing together the bridge builders**, i.e. **establishing structures for individuals to assist each other in each of the four intentions** mentioned above. This means that in the entire domain of striving towards flourishing, pleasurerealizers.org specializes in **establishing pleasure-inducing positive feedback loops**, that is:
- spreading the idea of Pleasure Realizers and making it accessible and understandable by every human on earth
- aggregating and distributing wisdom
- building platforms which connect people who aim to realize symbiotic pleasure
- forming organizational structures (e.g. physical spaces, universal basic income etc.) for people to become able to actually dedicate their time to each of the four intentions
- hosting events, building communities and eventually building societies and ecosystems oriented around the four intentions
# Co-creation
Following the spirit of realizing symbiotic pleasure, of course this is a co-creative work. If you deeply resonate with this as well, please get in touch via hey@pleasurerealizers.org.
