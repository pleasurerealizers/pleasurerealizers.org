# Deeply loving the present moment is actually possible. Let's make this passionate love for existence available to everyone.
Welcome to the Pleasure Realizers.
# Introduction
The overarching theme of Pleasure Realizers can be described by **"Building bridges between reality and reflected utopias"**, which results in
- five observations characterizing the architecture of our individual reflected utopias,
- one bridge statement which connects high-level, future-directed "flourishing" with immediate, realizable "pleasure" and
- five core intentions characterizing the realization of that pleasure, i.e. the Pleasure Realizers movement overall.

If you deeply resonate with them as well, please get in touch via hey@pleasurerealizers.org.
## Observations for reflected utopias
1. **metamotivation**: I strive for flourishing.
2. **oneness of mind**: I recognize that every other individual is also striving for flourishing in their life, even if not everyone is aware of it.
3. **subjectivity**: I recognize that flourishing can mean something different for every individual.
4. **reflection**: I recognize that my personal flourishing mirrors the flourishing of my environment.
5. **incompleteness**: I recognize that flourishing can never be ultimately reached as it always has a process and project character.
## Bridge
- **orientation**: Making steps **towards** flourishing happens by realizing subjective pleasure, both in the present moment and in an anticipatory way.
## Intentions for Pleasure Realizers
1. **understanding the self**: I want to learn what it means for me to experience pleasure.
2. **understanding others**: I want to use clear communication so that others can easily understand what it means for me to experience pleasure. I also want to understand what experiencing pleasure means for others.
3. **realizing pleasure for the self**: I want to actively infuse every aspect of my life with pleasure, both my thoughts and my behaviors.
4. **realizing symbiotic pleasure**: I want to discover and realize ways how interactions with others result in experiencing more pleasure on all sides.
5. **leveraging inequality**: I want to leverage inequality as a motivation for sharing that results in symbiotic pleasure.
