# Deeply loving the present moment is actually possible. Let's make passionate love for existence available to everyone.
Welcome to the Pleasure Realizers.
# Definitions
To explain what Pleasure Realizers is actually about, we need to introduce a few core concepts. They might be used here in a slightly different context than you are used to, so try to ignore what you already know about the meaning of these terms.
## Environment
In this context, your "environment" refers to everything which is **beyond** what you call your "self" or your "I". That is, the people and other beings around you as well as nature.
## Pleasure
"Pleasure" in the context of this framework refers to **subjective well-being in the present moment**. Colloquially, it can be interpreted as simply "feeling good", with all the subjective impreciseness this implies. Note the focus on the individual and subjectivity at this stage, which will be resolved later through the definition of "flourishing."

More concretely, this concept of pleasure can roughly be grouped into three aspects. Note that these aspects should not be seen as "stages" or a "sequence", but instead as parts which are all equally relevant without any specific order.
### Not suffering
This refers to the **fulfillment of basic needs**. After all, walking on the path towards flourishing is severely inhibited or pretty much impossible if someone is finding themselves in a state where immediate needs like the following are unfulfilled (the bottom layers of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), plus the most fundamental existential need):
- food, water, warmth, rest (surviving)
- physical or emotional safety (feeling safe)
- trust, belonging, self-confidence and freedom (feeling like your presence is appreciated and that you are trusted and loved, both by yourself and by others)
- accepting death
### Pleasurable stability
This refers to **being in a state where the fulfillment of these basic needs is something you perceive as stable**, i.e. where you don't need to be afraid of losing them. It includes factors such as:
- knowing that you have stable structures around you which ensure that you always have enough food, water, warmth and housing
- knowing that you genuinely appreciate your own body and feel safe in your own mind
- feeling a sense of belonging and living in circumstances which you like calling „home“, both physically and socially
- having structures where the fulfillment of some of your needs doesn't contradict the fulfillment of others (= freedom)
- having people in your social circles with whom you feel like you are not judged for embracing what feels pleasurable (= "authentic" or "true") to you
- knowing that you can always love and that you can always be loved, no matter what happens
- knowing that you have found peace with death, both your own and those of parts of your environment (e.g. other people you love)
- knowing that, even if some of your basic needs are not fulfilled, you always have the **hope** that it will get better and that you always have the **strength** to act accordingly
- having daily routines which consistently "feel good" and which you want to keep, because you know that they contribute to your pleasure in the future

Some associated terms for pleasurable stability include (both English and German):
- life satisfaction (Lebenszufriedenheit)
- joy of life (Lebensfreude)
- quality of life (Lebensqualität)
- fulfillment (Erfüllung)
- [subjective well-being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_well-being) and many other concepts studied by [positive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology)
- [eunoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunoia) in the works of Aristotle
- cultivating [brahmavihārā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmavihara) in buddhism
- [kama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama) in Dharmic religions
### Peak experiences
This refers to **an experience in which a limited set of pleasurable aspects is strongly emphasized temporarily**. Note that the temporary nature is what makes them pleasurable, i.e. living an entire life in only a single peak experience would typically not be sustainable or feasible in the long term.

This is yet another term from Maslow, who described [peak experiences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_experience) as "rare, exciting, oceanic, deeply moving, exhilarating, elevating experiences that generate an advanced form of perceiving reality, and are even mystic and magical in their effect upon the experimenter."

Some very general examples include:
- awe-inspiring natural encounters (e.g. watching a sunrise from a mountaintop after a long hike)
- creative flow while creating art (e.g. writing, composing, painting etc.)
- being in a deep conversation with someone where you don't even notice time flying
- being at an event where you have experiences which feel incredibly meaningful, pleasurable and inspirational to you (e.g. a burn)
- the mystical experience of an intense, but highly insightful trip on psychedelics
- a highly pleasurable sexual or sensual session (e.g. tantra, amazing orgasms, subspace etc.)
- dancing all night long to music you love (e.g. at a rave)
- feeling a rush of gratitude for someone's presence in a vulnerable moment
- religious celebrations for respective believers such as [Yom Kippur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur), [Eid al-Fitr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr), [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas), [Vesak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesak), [Chinese New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year) and many more (pretty much all cultures have institutionalized peak experiences)

Some associated terms include:
- euphoria (Euphorie)
- ecstasy (Ekstase)
- bliss (Glückseligkeit)
- rapture (Entzücken)
- elation (Beschwingtheit)
- [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) in the works of Csikszentmihalyi
- [dhyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhyana_in_Buddhism) in buddhism
- [samprajñata samādhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi#Sam%C4%81dhi_in_the_Yoga_S%C5%ABtras) in hinduism
## Flourishing
Finally, in this context, "flourishing" refers to **a hypothetical, idealized state of existence where pleasure is the norm in all aspects of life**. It is equivalent to "holistic subjective pleasure for everyone" = "holistic collective pleasure". Some associated terms include:
- [Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age) in Greek mythology
- [Sukhavati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhavati) in Buddhism
- [Satya Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Yuga) and [Svarga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svarga) in Hinduism
- the world envisioned in the [Taipingjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipingjing)
- the world envisioned in [Utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(book)) by Thomas More
- a society solely consisting of individuals striving for
	- Maslow's [self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization) (through [metamotivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamotivation))
	- Aristotle's [eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) (through [arete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete))
	- [moksha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha) or [nirvana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana) in Dharmic religions
	- [buddhahood or sammā-sambodhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhahood) in Buddhism (through [bodhicitta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhicitta))
# Why pleasure?
The next question is: **"Why should we even strive for pleasure?"**

For some, it will be rather intuitive that the aforementioned state of flourishing is desirable. However, some who are more existentially doubtful and have the bad habit of trying to objectively rationalize subjective pleasure might desire deeper reasoning. The following section makes an attempt at such reasoning from the perspective of humans. Note that this section is consciously agnostic towards any arguments related to transcendence, meaning that it does not assume or reject the existence of any state of being before birth or after death ([anamnesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy))). It is totally optional to understand, as you can probably come to the conclusion **that** you want to following pleasure also through other means.

In the following, I make an argument **for** pleasure purely for the **current moment**. But because this argumentative chain is always valid **at least** as long as you possess self-reflection and a body, it should become **subjectively infinite**.

**Trigger warning: The following section mentions suicide.**

This argumentative chain starts with the ultimate universal starting point ([Letztbegründung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letztbegr%C3%BCndung)) of "**Every human experiences their own existence**", involving that right now,
- you are experiencing self-awareness, i.e.
	- you are recognizing the existence of your own consciousness,
	- you thus recognize the existence of your self/ego/I, and
- you experience having a body.

While not assuming or rejecting [mind-body dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism), you still intuitively know that your mind is at least somehow connected to your body ([embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition)) and that your mind has at least some level of control over your body. Even if it might not be in control all the time, you can still make "conscious" decisions about what to do with your body, e.g. how you want to move your body, where you want to go to, what you want to say to whom, etc. That is, I assume that you **subjectively** perceive that you have at least a certain level of **free will**.

However this free will to move your body in which ever way you want also implies the **ability to decide for suicide** or to otherwise destroy your body. After all, you could easily acquire all the necessary tools and techniques to cause your body to stop functioning in its usual way. So the next question is **"Do I want to live or do I want to die?"**

To attempt answering this question, let's use the following rather narrow definitions, consistent with the previous paragraph: "living = the body functioning as usual" and "dying = making the body stop functioning as usual". Meaning that in this limited definition of "living", we come to the conclusion that "being alive" is pretty much equivalent to "having a body". Now, **what does it mean to have a body?**

Let's look again at all the different aspects mentioned above in the section "Pleasure" and what the presence of pleasure can look like. The thing they have in common is that they all **somehow involve the body**. Again, I'm not saying that after your body ceases to exist, you couldn't experience any pleasures at all anymore. But at least to experience the types of pleasure you **know**, you need a body and you shouldn't be dead. At the same time though, through your body you can also experience incredibly unpleasurable things, typically known as "pain" or "suffering". Of course in some cases, you can reinterpret this pain to foster learning, self-discipline, resilience or [equanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity), but no matter how you deal with it, initially it will always be pain.

But after all, you have a **choice**, which is by definition the most important choice of your life:
- Either you consciously decide for life, which will imply both earthly pleasures (as outlined above) and earthly suffering. And remember that before, you acknowledged that you have at least a certain level of free will and agency over what you want your body to do, meaning that you are the **architect** of your own pleasure and you can make decisions and behave in ways which lead you towards more subjective pleasure and away from subjective suffering. How to do this concretely is exactly what Pleasure Realizers is about and what the sections after this one will deal with.
- Or you consciously decide for death, after which you have no idea what will happen. Maybe pleasure, maybe suffering, maybe something totally different which cannot even be fathomed with our thoughts or words.

This is very similar to the argument which Camus makes for [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism), where we also all see ourselves as Sisyphos, but with the difference that we assume to have free will and can go towards holistic pleasure if we want to. Even though everything might still be ultimately meaningless, we still have free will most of the time, meaning that we can **decide** whether we want to roll up an immense boulder up a hill for eternity, or whether we want to do things which would still be meaningless, but can instead be really pleasurable in the moment.

Compare your life to gardening: No matter what you plant, eventually it will always die, including yourself, the planter! If you would want to, you could die right away and will never need to think about thunderstorms or lack of sunlight harming your crops or caring for a crop in the wrong way so that it dies.

But working in the garden itself, seeing each seed grow and blossom with the compost of yesteryear, inviting friends to garden parties and embracing this nurturing symbiosis with your surroundings will be an awesome experience again and again. You have an unlimited number of variants of seeds, some for grains or juicy fruits which nourish you, some for magical herbs which heal you or make your mind travel to distant worlds, some for cheeky flowers which blossom for just a few days per year, some for large trees which will far outlive you. Some of these seeds represent stability, some might represent playfulness, juiciness, care, a healthy relationship to death, self-love, trust, authenticity, community, love with others or anything else you want to foster in your life. The purpose of Pleasure Realizers is to form structures in which we can all nurture our individual and collective gardens of existence and to make them flourish, to exchange knowledge about the best holistic gardening techniques and to find people for the best garden parties ever.

If you continue reading on, I will assume that you have decided for life, for your body, for pleasure and, to get on the path towards flourishing, for realizing pleasure.
# Characterizing Pleasure Realizers
Pleasure Realizers can be summarized by **Building bridges of pleasure between reality and flourishing.**

First, let's make some **observations** about the nature of flourishing. The first one is a **commitment** by you, which connects you to all other Pleasure Realizers.

1. **metamotivation**: I strive for flourishing.
2. **oneness of mind**: I recognize that every other individual is also striving for flourishing, even if not everyone is aware of it.
3. **subjectivity**: I recognize that flourishing can mean something different for every individual.
4. **reflection**: I recognize that my personal flourishing mirrors the flourishing of my environment.
5. **incompleteness**: I recognize that flourishing can never be ultimately reached, instead it always has a process and project character.

Next, we have the **bridge**, i.e. how the abstract, idealized, future-thinking, unachievable "goal" of flourishing is connected to subjective pleasure in the moment:

- **orientation**: Making steps **towards** flourishing happens by realizing subjective pleasure, both in the present moment and in an anticipatory way.

And finally, the **intentions** for being able to actually build these bridges of pleasure:

1. **understanding the self**: I want to learn what it means for me to experience pleasure.
2. **understanding others**: I want to understand what experiencing pleasure means for my environment.
3. **realizing pleasure for the self, individual holism**: I want to actively infuse every aspect of my own life with pleasure, both my thoughts and my behaviors. I see myself as the core creator and cultivator of my own pleasure.
4. **realizing symbiotic pleasure**: I want to discover and realize ways how interactions with my environment result in experiencing more pleasure on all sides.
